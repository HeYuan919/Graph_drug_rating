The GNN_main.ipynb is to reproduce the main results. 

The GNN_main_fixed.ipynb is the corrected file with one fixed small error, and the corrected RMSE (std) on Drug(multi) and Drug(single) is 3.310 (0.008) and 2.676 (0.057) for SAGEModel, 3.290 (0.003) and 2.809 (0.046) for GATModel.


The preprocess.ipynb is to get the statistics of datasets.

All files can run directly on Colab without environment configuration.
