# Graph_drug_rating

The GNN_main.ipynb is to reproduce the main results. 

The GNN_main_fixed.ipynb is the corrected file with one fixed calculation error, and the corrected RMSE (std) on Drug(multi) and Drug(single) is 3.310 (0.008) and 2.676 (0.057) for SAGEModel, 3.290 (0.003) and 2.809 (0.046) for GATModel, which are lower by 0.6-0.7 than those in the original result table.


The preprocess.ipynb is to get the statistics of datasets.

All files can run directly on Colab without environment configuration.
